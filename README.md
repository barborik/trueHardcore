# trueHardcore
trueHardcore plugin deletes every world file in your server directory and stops the server on player death.<br>
I have included a startup script that automatically restarts the server when it stops. (both Linux and Windows versions)<br>
Expect some chunk saving errors, dont mind them, it can't save what does not exist.
